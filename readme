## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* API Keys for:
    * Google Gemini
    * Firecrawl
    * SerpAPI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JobFit-AI.git  # Replace your-username
    cd JobFit-AI
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download SpaCy Model:**

    ```bash
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
    ```

5. **Set up API keys:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    * Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key
    SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
    ```

    *Alternatively, you can set these API keys directly in the Streamlit UI (sidebar), but using a `.env` file is generally better for security and organization.*

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
